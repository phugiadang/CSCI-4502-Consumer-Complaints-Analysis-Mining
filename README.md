##Introduction to Consumer Complaints Analysis:
Customer complaints analysis is the new and big research area in many companies nowadays. There are increasingly number of companies recognising the value of a customer complaint in that it is free feedback on their experience. Each week there are thousands of consumers complaints about the financial products and services that financial companies provide. By submitting a complaint, a consumer can make their voice be heard by the financial institution. Consumers can get help with their issues and help others avoid similar issues they experienced. Every complaint that is made provides awareness to the issues and problems the consumers are experiencing with the financial institution. Analyzing these complaints provides better results for the consumers and an overall improved financial marketplace for everyone. Therefore, customer complaints analysis is one important key for any successful  businesses.

Our datasets comes from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [2]. The data attributes that can be found in this data set includes the the types of complaints (credit card, debit card, money transfer, and etc), issues of the complaints, sub-issue (identity theft, dispute, etc.), location and date of complaints, the company who received the complaint, the company response and if the complaints were made public are also documented. The Consumer Complaint Database is collected from 524,829 complaints, on a range of consumer financial products and services, sent to nearly 3,000 companies for response. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau doesnâ€™t verify all the facts alleged in these complaints, but they take some special steps to confirm a commercial relationship between the consumer and the company. The database contains consumer complaints from **July 2011** until **March 27, 2016**.
